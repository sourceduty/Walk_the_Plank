### Walk the Plank

The object of [Walk the Plank](https://chat.openai.com/g/g-a2T0z5vN2-walk-the-plank) is to guess the secret word before the stick figure walks off of the wooden plank. Players take turns selecting letters to narrow the word down. Gameplay continues until the players guess the word or they run out of guesses and the stick figure is in the water.
